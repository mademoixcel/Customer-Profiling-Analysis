## 1. Introduction 

![img_1](https://github.com/mademoixcel/Customer-Profiling-Analysis/assets/124081194/74c340b1-d912-400a-ad4e-862f8a8ea7f2)


This project focuses on a fictional retail store that operates through multiple channels and aims to enhance its marketing strategies through customer profiling and segmentation.
The dataset was updated 4 months ago on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somesh140/segmentation)





## 2. Business Problem

![eb0dac0e4bb1e60a83b2a2727c4eff18](https://github.com/mademoixcel/Customer-Profiling-Analysis/assets/124081194/ecdbab3a-d8f6-4abf-8018-ae4732930037)




A well-known retail company with a physical location and an online presence is having difficulty efficiently targeting its broad client base with relevant marketing initiatives. The organization intends to use consumer profile and segmentation approaches to improve its marketing efforts and provide customers with individualized experiences. The goal is to improve overall customer happiness while increasing customer engagement and how much they spend.


## 3. Challenges:
![LY0W](https://github.com/mademoixcel/Customer-Profiling-Analysis/assets/124081194/7d5ac5cf-c1fd-426c-9bd4-508d0b2bf2ab)

<b>Diverse Customer Base:</b> The retail chain has customers ‚Äì with different age distribution, different shopping patterns, and they like different things. Trying to use the same marketing for everyone doesn't work anymore because each group of customers is unique.

<b>Segmentation Complexity:</b> Due to the large customer base, which consists of over 2000 individuals, and the extensive information collected about each customer, it has become a complex task to identify the unique spending behaviors and patterns within various customer segments.

<b>Ineffective Campaigns:</b> Some marketing campaigns are generic and lack personalization. As a result, they don't stand out or feel special to the customers.

## 4. Objectives:

The main aim of this project is to develop a strategy for understanding customers and sorting them into different groups. This will allow the retail chain to send personalized marketing messages. The project seeks to accomplish the following goals:

1. Create a plan to gather detailed information about customers and categorize them into different types.
   
2. Use these methods to help the store improve its performance and attract more customers who will enjoy their products.
