A well-established retail chain with a store and an online presence is facing challenges in effectively targeting its diverse customer base with relevant marketing campaigns. The company wants to leverage customer profiling and segmentation techniques to enhance its marketing strategies and create personalized experiences for its customers. The goal is to increase customer engagement, drive higher sales, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## 3. Challenges:

<b>Diverse Customer Base:</b> The retail chain has customers – with different age distribution, different shopping patterns, and they like different things. Trying to use the same marketing for everyone doesn't work anymore because each group of customers is unique.

<b>Segmentation Complexity:</b> Due to the large customer base, which consists of over 2000 individuals, and the extensive information collected about each customer, it has become a complex task to identify the unique spending behaviors and patterns within various customer segments.

Ineffective Campaigns: The current marketing campaigns are generic and lack personalization. This results in low conversion rates and a suboptimal return on investment (ROI) for marketing efforts.

Resource Allocation: The retail chain needs to optimize its marketing budget by directing resources towards segments that are more likely to convert and deliver a higher lifetime value.
